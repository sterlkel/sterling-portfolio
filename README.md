## Sterling Kelly's Portfolio!!!

Hello and welcome! You have made it to my github and are looking at my repo for portfolio! This website should exclusively be used to check out whatever I have going on!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project was deployed using Vercel, and uses both Tailwind and bootstrap for styling.

MaterialUI is also used for many UI components.

Give it a look! Any recommendations are welcomed!
